# Why?
Because everyone's talking about "The jQuery days", and I feel old. I feel that I ought to be using React.

# Ok, so what is this?
I'm not sure. Is it a framework? Kind of. Is it just me experimenting, sure. Is it something you can use? Maybe- so I made it free like beer and like freedom (License: MIT). Sasm is protected on NPM. That may change someday, but until then contact me for access. You do not need Sasm to use this, make your own server for now or just use the dev server, it works fine.

# What's it do?
Uhh, well so far it's just a framework or layout plan. It's like a starting point, but I'm continuously building onto it- be it right or wrong. I plan on making more components for us to use, and I welcome feedback or even contributions.

The build steps are working, and right now are through webpack with the help of babel. Oh, did I mention I'm using S(C|A)SS- a compile-to-css thingy? Yeah, there's that. I'm not really good at React or Sass, but those are things. 

Someday I'll go through this readme and change all of the brand names to links and stuff. 

This thingy is fucking raw as fuck, so take it as me experimenting.
